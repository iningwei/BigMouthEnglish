# Japan's anime industry in crisis even as its popularity soars

Three of the 10 feature films in the running for top prize at the world's most important animation festival in Annecy in France are from Japan.

But Japan's booming animation industry is in crisis-with bad working conditions,a huge shortage of artists and a lack of creativity-just as its global polularity has never been higher.

With talk of a talent shortage,its greatest star,the legendary Studio Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki,has come out of retirement at 78 to make "How Do You Live?"-which may be released next year-with speculation that he could take on another feature if his health holds.

Yoshiaki Nishimura,a former Miyazaki stalwart who produced the Oscar-nonimated "The Tale of The Princess Kaguya",told AFP that his peers also complain of low pay,a paucity of emerging young talent and burn-out in overworked animation teams who often put in 12-to 18-hour days.

Ayumu Watanabe - whose beautiful "The Children of the Sea" was shown out of competition at the festival - worried about visual "standardization" and lack of originality,with "fewer and fewer nimators who can draw well by hand."

Amel Lacombe,whose company Eurozoom is a key French animation distributor,said the industry's travails are due to its rapid growth,and now "we are in a period of adjustment".She believes that the Japanese authorities are waking up to anime's importance and global reach "as a export force".
